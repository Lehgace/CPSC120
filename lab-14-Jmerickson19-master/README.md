# Lab 14
Throughout the semester, we learned how to:
* Declare variables of various types
* Prompt the user for input in 2 ways, using `cin` and `argv`
* Perform various operators, such as `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `%`, `=`
* Write programs that make decisions using `if`, `else-if`, `else`
* Write programs to iterate on sets of data or repeatedly perform actions based on variable state using `while`, `do-while`, and `for`
* Declare, initialize, set, and access variables in arrays
* Break repeated code down into modular functions for organization, readability, and maintainability
* Nest functions, `if` statements, loops, etc.
* Declare and operate on variables in different scopes
* Operate on 2D arrays
* Track varying-numbers of inputs using `std::vector`
* Track associated values with keys using `std::unordered_map` and `std::pair`
* Use git and GitHub
* Write clean, maintainable code
* Create a program from scratch to your liking and with your rules using the tools you've learned so far
* Take a problem you've seen before and apply it to a new problem you haven't
* And many, many, many other skills along the way.

## Objectives
To put everything you've learned this semester together into a super hard mega project due at the end of class

## Part 1
This will be a <i>substantial</i> coding exercise. Open `part-1/part1.cpp` and follow the instructions inside.

## Part 2
Open `part-2/part2.cpp` and read the instructions inside. Just think about the solution, no need to write any code for it, unless of course, you really want to.

## Part 3
Open `part-3/part3.txt` and read the instructions inside.

## Part 4
Open `part-4/part4.txt` and answer the questions inside.

## Part 5
Read `part-5/part5.txt`.

## Grading
* (10 points) Your `part-4/part4.txt` answers all the questions inside to the best of your ability.
