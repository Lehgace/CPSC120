1. What major are you?

  Currently enrolled as a Computer Engineering Major, but planning on changing
  it to Computer Science Major.

2. If you were already in Computer Science or Computer Engineering, would you
   want to stay in the major? Or if you are majoring in something else, would
   you consider CS/CE as a major you'd pursue? Why or why not?

   Yes, I would like to stay in the Computer Science Major. Quite simply,
   the future for technology and coding is bright and will most likely be a
   valuable skill-set for years to come (as if it wasn't already).

3. Take a moment to reflect on everything you've learned in this class. In 1-2
   sentences, what are your key takeaways from this class? You can talk about
   anything you learned, were or weren't expecting, about the material, what you
   learned about yourself, anything!

   One thing I learned from this class is that coding is an elaborate artform
   in a sense. There are multiple ways to tackle a problem, and sometimes it
   takes a few compiler errors, bug fixes, and broken keyboards until you
   finally craft something that works the way you intended. When I finally did
   finish that challenging lab or project 3, I felt like a computer mastermind
   that had the HelloWorld in his fingertips.


4. Any other thoughts or comments you'd like to leave?

  Two wise men once left me with the following words of wisdom. One man said
  that "A true master is an eternal student." Another man once said that
  "Coding is hard." Both are very valuable statements I will remember for the
  rest of my days.
